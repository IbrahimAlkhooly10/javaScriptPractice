                            <strong>extinct animals</strong> Recently extinct mammals are defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as any mammals that have become extinct since the year 1500 CE.[1] Since then, roughly 80 mammal species have become extinct.[2]
                            Extinction of taxa is difficult to confirm, as a long gap without a sighting is not definitive, but before 1995 a threshold of 50 years without a sighting was used to declare extinction.[1]
                            One study found that extinction from habitat loss is the hardest to detect, as this might only fragment populations to the point of concealment from humans. Some mammals declared as extinct 
                            may very well reappear.[1] For example, a study found that 36% of purported mammalian extinction had been resolved, while the rest either had validity issues (insufficient evidence) or had been rediscovered.[3]
                            As of December 2015, the IUCN listed 30 mammalian species as "critically endangered (possibly extinct)".

                            <strong>what will happen if the animals dont extinct</strong> De-extinction (also known as resurrection biology, or species revivalism) is the process of generating an organism that is either an extinct species or resembles an extinct species.[1] There are several <br>
                            ways to carry out the process of de-extinction. Cloning is the most widely proposed method, <br>
                            although genome editing and selective breeding have also been considered. Similar techniques have been applied to certain endangered species, in hopes to boost populations. <br>
                            The only method of the three that would provide an animal with the same genetic identity is cloning.[2] There are both pros and cons to the process of de-extinction ranging from technological advancements to ethical issues.
