        <p><strong>what rare animals meanes</strong>An endangered species is a species that is very likely to become extinct in the near future,<br> 
        either worldwide or in a particular politicalEndangered species may be at risk due to factors such as habitat loss, poaching and invasive species.<br> 
        The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List lists the global conservation status of many species, and various other agencies assess the status of<br> 
        species within particular areas. Many nations have laws that protect conservation-reliant species which, for example, forbid hunting, restrict land<br> 
        development, or create protected areas. Some endangered species are the target of extensive conservation efforts such as captive breeding and habitat restoration.</p>
